# solid-js with bun and elysiajs

this project is part of a larger project for myself to learn how a framework is created
 

## [entrypoints](./entry/entry-server.tsx)

look into the entry folder and configure/adjust the client side and server side ssr handlers as needed

## routing

check the routes folder for how to add api routes

more info can be found at [Elysiajs](https://elysiajs.com/quick-start.html)


## how its done
 most of the logic to actually get this working is in [lib](./lib.ts)
 and the [solid-js Plugin](./plugins/solid.ts)
