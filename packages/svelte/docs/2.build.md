# Build step

next we need to choose our frontend framework we would like to use to render our app, i decided to use svelte because the syntaxing looks enjoyable

```bash
bun add -d svelte svelte-preprocess
```
to be able to actually use svelte we now need to create a plugin for Bun that will process these fils

```js
//plugins/svelte.ts

// this example does not include caching, the actual project does!
export const sveltePlugin: BunPlugin = {
        name: 'svelte loader',
        async setup ( build ) {
            // helps us use this plugin as both a browser bundler plugin and as a runtime plugin
            const target = build.config?.target === 'browser' ? 'dom' : 'ssr';

            // only process svelte files
            build.onLoad( { filter: /\.(svelte)$/ }, async ( { path } ) => {
                const svelte = await import( "svelte/compiler" );
                // processes the svelte files and compiles them to javascript classes
                let content = await Bun.file( path ).text();

                // here we use preprocess from svelte-preprocess to help with usage of scss/less/pug and more
                const processed = await svelte.preprocess( content, preprocess(/** options */));
                const compiled = svelte.compile( processed.code, {
                    filename: path,
                    generate: target,
                    hydratable: options.ssr,
                } );
                return { contents: compiled.js.code, loader: 'js' };
            } );
        }}
```

now how do we actually start using this? first we will need to create a build step for our app and figure out how to create routing for our entrypoints to feed into the bundler.

lucky bun has some built-ins to help with this

```js
// utils/routers.ts
export const srcRouter = new FileSystemRouter( {
    style: 'nextjs',
    dir: './pages'
} )

// {"/": "path/to/pages/dir/index.svelte"}
```
we now can create routes similar to how they are in nextjs pages directory and this will return those routes, we will follow up on this later

now we still need to bundle these files to be usable in a browser

```js
// build.ts
const clientBuild = await Bun.build( {
    entrypoints: [ 'entry-client.ts', ...Object.values( srcRouter.routes ) ],
    splitting: true,
    target: 'browser',
    outdir: `${BUILD_DIR}/client`,
    minify: prod,
    plugins: [ sveltePlugin],
});

```
after running built.ts we should have a build directory with our bundled application code. keep in mind the outdir we set above will be important during routing.

now the next question is how do we make svelte components importable and usable on the server, which is actually pretty easy since we made our plugin cross compatible with the targets

```js
// plugins/preload.ts

import { sveltePlugin } from "./plugins/svelte.ts";

Bun.plugin(sveltePlugin)
```

the above will need to run before any of our other code does, so that when we come across svelte files we do not run into errors

```js
// bunfig.toml
preload=['./plugins/preloads.ts']
```
