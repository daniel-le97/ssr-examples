# Prelude - building my own ssr framework

At first this project was just supposed to get svelte running in SSR mode with bun. The only problem with that is i kept running into DX (developer experience) issues.
I ideally just wanted to be able to choose a framework and define my own workflows to develope my applications my own way.
Keep in mind working with Bun has been my first time messing with any runtime other than node/browsers and bundling, transpiling, caching are all very new to me.
I hope this project may be able to inspire others!

# Getting started

Bun has a very simple install process

```bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

after that getting a project going is as simple as going to your directory of choice and running

```bash
bun init
```

the above command should have scaffolded a baic Bun template configured with typescript by default.
if you notice there is a /src directory, im going to remove it and create an index.ts at the base of my project

```bash
rm -rf src && touch index.ts
```
next i wanted a directory structure similar to all of the other meta-frameworks(Next/Nuxt)

```bash
mkdir assets components pages plugins utils
```
you should now have a directory structure similar to what you are familiar with if you have used a meta-framework

next: [build-step](./2.build.md)
