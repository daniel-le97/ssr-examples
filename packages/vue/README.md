# bun-vue-ssr

This project is heavily inspired by the following repositories:

- [Bux - Own-Nuxt-Like-Framework](https://github.com/LowByteFox/Own-Nuxt-Like-Framework)
- [react-ssr](https://github.com/bun-community/create-templates): from the bun-community templates used before bun v1.0

- no script-setup 
- script only

- normal SFC's with setup


# Caveats 
not all compiling options for vue SFC's are implemented
